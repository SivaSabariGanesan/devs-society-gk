# Batch Year Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide provides all the necessary steps to implement the multi-tenure system with batch years in your Devs Society Portal. The system allows multiple admins to be active simultaneously for the same college, each representing different batch years (e.g., hursun for 2024 batch, gokul for 2025 batch).

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Access to your Supabase project
- Database admin privileges
- All code changes have been applied (already completed)

## 🗄️ Database Changes Required

### Step 1: Add Batch Year Columns

Run these SQL commands in your **Supabase SQL Editor**:

```sql
-- Add batch_year column to admins table
ALTER TABLE admins ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS batch_year INTEGER;

-- Add batch_year column to college_tenure_heads table  
ALTER TABLE college_tenure_heads ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS batch_year INTEGER;

-- Add comments to document the columns
COMMENT ON COLUMN admins.batch_year IS 'Year of the batch this admin represents (e.g., 2024, 2025)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN college_tenure_heads.batch_year IS 'Year of the batch for this tenure period';
```

### Step 2: Update Existing Data

After adding the columns, run these commands to populate existing data:

```sql
-- Update hursun admin to batch 2024
UPDATE admins SET batch_year = 2024 WHERE email LIKE '%hursun%' OR username = 'hursun';

-- Update gokul admin to batch 2025  
UPDATE admins SET batch_year = 2025 WHERE email LIKE '%gokul%' OR username = 'gokul';

-- Update other admins to batch 2024 (default)
UPDATE admins SET batch_year = 2024 WHERE batch_year IS NULL AND role = 'admin';

-- Update college_tenure_heads with corresponding batch years
UPDATE college_tenure_heads 
SET batch_year = admins.batch_year 
FROM admins 
WHERE college_tenure_heads.admin_id = admins.id 
AND college_tenure_heads.batch_year IS NULL;
```

### Step 3: Verify the Updates

Run this query to verify the data was updated correctly:

```sql
-- Verify the updates
SELECT 
  a.id,
  a.full_name,
  a.username,
  a.batch_year,
  c.name as college_name
FROM admins a
LEFT JOIN colleges c ON a.assigned_college_id = c.id
WHERE a.role = 'admin'
ORDER BY c.name, a.batch_year;
```

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

### Backend Features
- ✅ Multi-tenure support in `AdminService`
- ✅ Batch year validation (2000-2030 range)
- ✅ Unique batch year enforcement per college
- ✅ Updated `CollegeService` to return multiple tenure heads
- ✅ Enhanced admin creation with batch year
- ✅ Transfer tenure functionality with batch year support

### Frontend Features
- ✅ Multi-admin display in `SuperAdminDashboard`
- ✅ Batch year field in admin creation form
- ✅ Admin assignment with batch year selection
- ✅ Duplicate batch year prevention
- ✅ Enhanced college display showing all active admins

### Database Types
- ✅ Updated TypeScript interfaces to include `batch_year`
- ✅ Proper type definitions for all operations

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### Step 1: Run the Test Script

After adding the database columns, run this command:

```bash
cd portal.devs-society/backend
npx ts-node src/scripts/testMultiTenureSystem.ts
```

### Step 2: Expected Results

The test should show:
- Multiple admins per college (e.g., REC with hursun and gokul)
- Different batch years for each admin
- Proper data structure validation
- No duplicate batch years per college

### Step 3: Manual Testing

1. **Create New Admin with Batch Year:**
   - Go to Super Admin Dashboard
   - Click "Create Admin"
   - Fill in details including batch year
   - Verify admin is created with correct batch year

2. **Assign Admin to College:**
   - Go to Colleges tab
   - Click "Assign Admin" on a college
   - Select admin and specify batch year
   - Verify assignment works correctly

3. **Verify Multiple Admins:**
   - Check that multiple admins can be active for the same college
   - Verify each admin has a different batch year
   - Confirm no duplicate batch years per college

## 🎯 Key Features

### Multi-Tenure System
- **Multiple Active Admins**: Each college can have multiple active admins
- **Batch Year Assignment**: Each admin represents a specific batch year
- **Unique Enforcement**: No duplicate batch years per college
- **Tenure Management**: Proper start/end dates for each tenure

### User Management
- **Batch Year Assignment**: Users specify their batch year during registration
- **Admin Assignment**: Users are automatically assigned to the correct admin based on batch year
- **Event Participation**: Events can target specific batch years or multiple batches

### Event Management
- **Batch-Specific Events**: Events can be created for specific batch years
- **Multi-Batch Events**: Annual meetups can include multiple batch years
- **Participant Filtering**: Event participants can be filtered by batch year

## 🔧 Configuration

### Batch Year Range
The system validates batch years between 2000-2030. To change this range, update the validation in:
- `src/routes/superAdmin.ts` (admin creation route)
- `src/components/SuperAdminDashboard.tsx` (frontend validation)

### Default Batch Year
When creating admins without specifying a batch year, the system defaults to 2024. This can be changed in:
- `src/services/adminService.ts` (createAdmin method)

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Database Constraints
- Each college can have multiple active admins
- Each admin can only have one active tenure per college
- Batch years must be unique per college
- Super admins cannot have batch years

### Migration Safety
- The SQL commands use `IF NOT EXISTS` to prevent errors
- Existing data is preserved and updated with appropriate batch years
- The system is backward compatible

### Testing Recommendations
- Test with multiple colleges and admins
- Verify batch year uniqueness enforcement
- Test admin transfer functionality
- Confirm event creation with batch years

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues during implementation:

1. **Check the logs** in your Supabase dashboard
2. **Verify the SQL commands** executed successfully
3. **Run the test script** to identify any issues
4. **Check TypeScript compilation** for any remaining errors

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
- ✅ Database columns are added without errors
- ✅ Existing data is updated with batch years
- ✅ Test script runs successfully
- ✅ Multiple admins can be active per college
- ✅ Batch year validation works correctly
- ✅ Frontend displays multiple admins properly
- ✅ Admin creation and assignment work with batch years
